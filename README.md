This is a 2-hour take-home iOS (Swift) project task.
I
Build and run instructions:
  - To be built and run using XCode and a simulator/device running iOS 17.0 or later

Implementation decisions:
  - It was decided to prioritse delivering the minimum viable product that meets the set criteria within the set 2 hour time frame
  - As such, UI elements should be improved, as well as data persistence to be added.
  - With time, then UI would be improved, persistence storage would have been added (using Swift Data and separating the model objects from DTO's), some unit tests added, previews improved using local mock data
  - Total time spent on project (15 mins + 1:50 mins)
